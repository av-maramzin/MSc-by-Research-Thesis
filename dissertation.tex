%% Load the class. Put any options that you want here (see the documentation
%% for the list of options). The following are samples for each type of
%% thesis:
%%
%% Note: you can also specify any of the following options:
%%  logo: put a University of Edinburgh logo onto the title page
%%  frontabs: put the abstract onto the title page
%%  deptreport: produce a title page that fits into a Computer Science
%%      departmental cover [not sure if this actually works]
%%  singlespacing, fullspacing, doublespacing: choose line spacing
%%  oneside, twoside: specify a one-sided or two-sided thesis
%%  10pt, 11pt, 12pt: choose a font size
%%  centrechapter, leftchapter, rightchapter: alignment of chapter headings
%%  sansheadings, normalheadings: headings and captions in sans-serif
%%      (default) or in the same font as the rest of the thesis
%%  [no]listsintoc: put list of figures/tables in table of contents (default:
%%      not)
%%  romanprepages, plainprepages: number the preliminary pages with Roman
%%      numerals (default) or consecutively with the rest of the thesis
%%  parskip: don't indent paragraphs, put a blank line between instead
%%  abbrevs: define a list of useful abbreviations (see documentation)
%%  draft: produce a single-spaced, double-sided thesis with narrow margins
%%
%% For a PhD thesis -- you must also specify a research institute:
%\documentclass[phd,ilcc,twoside]{infthesis}
\documentclass[mscres,icsa,logo,twoside]{infthesis}

%% For an MPhil thesis -- also needs an institute
% \documentclass[mphil,ianc]{infthesis}

%% MSc by Research, which also needs an institute
% \documentclass[mscres,irr]{infthesis}

%% Taught MSc -- specify a particular degree instead. If none is specified,
%% "MSc in Informatics" is used.
% \documentclass[msc,cogsci]{infthesis}
% \documentclass[msc]{infthesis}  % for the MSc in Informatics

%% Master of Informatics (5 year degree)
% \documentclass[minf]{infthesis}

%% Undergraduate project -- specify the degree course and project type
%% separately
% \documentclass[bsc]{infthesis}

\abstract{%
\qquad Parallelism pervades the modern computing world. Almost all modern computing systems provide parallel computing hardware resources to some degree or another. The major problem in the field is that these available resources are not always efficiently utilized. To take the most out of these parallel resources, applications running on them must be parallel as well. \newline 
\null\qquad Despite the progress in parallel programming languages design and increased availability of parallel programming frameworks, writing efficient parallel software from scratch is still a challenging task, mastered by only a few expert programmers. While these experts combine domain knowledge, algorithmic insight and parallel programming skills, most “average” programmers are often lacking skills in at least one of these areas. In this project we investigate methods for providing programmers with real-time feedback on the quality of their code with respect to parallelization opportunities and scalability to address short-comings before they manifest as suboptimal and hard-to-parallelise code.\newline \null\qquad We draw on the experience of the software engineering community and software metrics originally developed to identify low quality sequential code, typically prone to errors and hard to maintain. The goal of this project is to develop novel software parallelisability metrics, which can be used as quality indicators for parallel code and guide the software development process towards better parallel code.
